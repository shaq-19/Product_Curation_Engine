I really love the Bluetooth Speaker I got from the campus store â€“ it's compact and loud!
The XL Twin Sheet Set is so soft and perfect for dorm beds.
Laptop stands should be included more, everyone in STEM needs one.
We need more healthy snack options, maybe even organic ones.
Noise cancelling headphones were too expensive for me.
Can we have more eco-friendly options like fleece blankets?
