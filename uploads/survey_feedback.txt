I really love the Bluetooth Speaker I got from the campus store â€“ it's compact and loud!
The XL Twin Sheet Set is so soft and perfect for dorm beds.
Laptop stands should be included more, everyone in STEM needs one.
We need more healthy snack options, maybe even organic ones.
Noise cancelling headphones were too expensive for me.
Can we have more eco-friendly options like fleece blankets?
The reusable water bottles are great but could come in more colors.
I wish there were more ergonomic desk chairs available for study spaces.
Portable phone chargers are a lifesaver during long campus days.
More LED desk lamps would be awesome, especially ones with adjustable brightness.
The campus store should stock more backpacks with laptop compartments.
Coffee mugs with cool designs would make nice gifts.
Fitness bands or smartwatches would be a popular addition for health-conscious students.
Comfortable hoodies with the college logo are always a hit.
We'd love to see some insulated lunch bags for carrying meals.
